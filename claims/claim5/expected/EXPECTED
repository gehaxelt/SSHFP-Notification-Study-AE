This folder contains the table with the results of our thematic analysis (see Appendix F1 in the paper) which we define as expected outcome, when the codebook is used to code the responses in the document 'responses' that we included in this folder. 

As with every thematic analysis there is some room for interpretation and reviewers might come to slightly different results than we did. As described in Section 4.4 'Thematic Analysis of Responses' inter-rater reliability (IRR) was calculated using Cohen’s Kappa, reaching an IRR of κ = 0.74.
