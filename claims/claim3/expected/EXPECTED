The expected output depends on the users' input. In essence, the expected output for the selftest tool is that it runs and produces output as soon as the user enters a domain. To visualize potential output, we added screenshots of different scan scenarious, i.e., the STT's frontpage, the output when the user is not allowed to scan a domain as the token is not correct, and a successful scan output.
