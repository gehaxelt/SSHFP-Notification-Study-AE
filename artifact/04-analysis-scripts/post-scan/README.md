## Statistical Analysis with SPSS

To analyze the differences between our treatment groups, we used single-factor ANOVA (with days until remediation as continuous dependent variable) and Chi^2-test (with status as dichotomous dependent variable). We used two-factor ANOVA to determine interaction effects between the sender and the institution providing the selfservice tool (STT), and, finally, we used survival analysis to determine remediation behavior over time. 

## Thematic Analysis of Responses

For the thematic analysis of the responses, we used a codebook that we adapted from literature.
