# Intended use + limitations

The provided data shall be used to reprocude our results from the paper "Fix it - If you Can! Towards Understanding the Impact of Tool Support and Domain Ownersâ€™ Reactions to SSHFP Misconfigurations".

There are some limitations with the data we can provide in the repository due to privacy/anonymity concerns. Thus, we only provide the ground-truth data (i.e. domains), but not the intermediate or final result data sets, which would include the affected (vulnerable) domains.
However, we provided dummy data sets in all cases, to ensure that the analysis scripts will run with the intermediate data.
